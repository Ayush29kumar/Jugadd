Program 5 : Write a program to demonstrate the Birthday Attack on a hash function. Assume a hash function that produces values between 0 and 999. Randomly generate hash values until a duplicate (collision) is found. Display how many random values were needed before the first collision occurred.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

#define HASH_SPACE 1000  // Hash values range from 0 to 999

int main() {
	// Seed random number generator
	srand(time(NULL));

	// Array to track seen hash values
	bool hash_seen[HASH_SPACE] = { false };

	int attempts = 0;
	int hash_value;

	printf("Starting Birthday Attack Simulation...\n");
	printf("----------------------------------------\n");

	while (1) {
    	hash_value = rand() % HASH_SPACE;  // Generate random hash [0, 999]
    	attempts++;

    	printf("Attempt %d: Generated hash value = %d --> ", attempts, hash_value);

    	if (hash_seen[hash_value]) {
        	printf("Collision Detected!\n");
        	printf("\nSummary:\n");
        	printf(" - Total attempts made: %d\n", attempts);
        	printf(" - Collided hash value: %d\n", hash_value);
        	break;
    	} else {
        	printf("No collision, marking as seen.\n");
        	hash_seen[hash_value] = true;
    	}
	}

	printf("----------------------------------------\n");
	printf("Birthday Attack Simulation Completed.\n");

	return 0;
}

  Output :
